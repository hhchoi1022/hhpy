; Valid altitude and azimuth values must be in decimal. Altitude -90.0 to +90.0, 
; Azimuth 0.0 to less than +360.0. Sexagesimal is not supported. Also, altitude
; must be ABOVE YOUR MOUNT'S LIMITS! So if you need -10 altitude for your panel,
; your mount's limit probably needs to be set below -10 not exactly -10.

; and safety limnits set in ACP and your mount! Uncomment PostFlatAz and set it
; to the desired post-flat slew azimuth. If left commented-out the post-flat
; slew will use the telescope azimuth at the end of flat acquisition, avoiding
; a flip if the mount is a GEM.

; Factors to improve exposure scaling process. The scaling process 
; assumes no additional time for downloads. For cameras with relatively 
; long download times (~20+ seconds), that assumption may not be accurate 
; enough to keep the ADU levels within TargetADUTolerance. The scaling 
; factor will be less than 1.0 in the morning and greater than 1.0 in 
; the evening. STARTING POINTS are 0.95 and 1.05 respectively. The values
; 1 and 1 are here for differences in decimal point '.' versus ',' and 
; so you NEED TO EDIT THESE!

; These are the EL panel brightness values for each filter. They must be
; in the same order as your filters (as listed in MaxIm DL). Adjust these
; on the high side so that the resulting flat exposures fall towards the 
; short end of the exposure range (to minimize the time needed to acquire 
; flats!). This also minimizes the effects of ambient light leakage. The 
; permissible values range from 0 to 255. Start with 192.
;
; DO NOT COMMENT THESE 4 LISTS OUT. If you don't need brightness, just leave 
; them alone and just don't put the #BRT# into the command line (see below).

; These are the command lines for turning the flat light source on and off.
; If #BRT# appears in the command line, the brightness value for the current
; filter (from the above array) will be substituted. For FlipFlat and FlatMan
; see the provided documentation and include the 'S' option so the command
; window doesn't hang there for several seconds. This is really simple and 
; only needs to be done once. The most common error is getting the COM port 
; wrong. The commands below are for the Alnitak/Optec FlipFlat and include
; options for opening and closing the lighted cover plate. For the FlatMan
; anf FlatMan XL, remove the 'C' and 'O' options. For other light sources 
; these commands may be used to control an programmable power outlet, etc.
