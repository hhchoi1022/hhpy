; ACP Expert Scheduler custom log path & name template
; ====================================================
;
; Construct the full path/name template for ACP run logs produced for ACP
; Scheduler initiated runs. Comments start with ';', blank lines are ignored. 
; DON'T INSERT TABS! Illegal path/file characters such as '?' and "\" in 
; names will be filtered out or substituted with legal characters. 
; In addition, for file names only, parentheses will be filtered out.
;
; WARNING! DO NOT INCLUDE THE ".log" ON THE END! If no template is given
; the standard ACP Scheduler log path and name will be used.
;
; Each scheduler user can (optionally) have their own path/name setup. Include 
; a separate template for the user, prefixed by the user name in square 
; brackets. See the examples at the end of this file. NOTE: Per-user templates
; must PRECEDE the default one.
;
; The following substitution tokens are provided 
; (some are rather useless for logs!):
;
;   Token       Description
;   ----------  --------------------------------------------------------------
;   $DEFPATH    The ACP Local User default logs path (see ACP Preferences,
;               Local User tab), a "Scheduler" folder under that, then
;               a folder with the Project's Observer name under that.
;               OR IF SUBMITTED VIA ACP WEB FORM: The path to the ACP web user's 
;               logs. In this case, the Project Contact Name will be of the 
;               form "Joe Observer [ACP joeuser]"
;
;   $WEBROOT    The ACP "Path to web document root" (see ACP preferences,
;               Servers tab)
;
;   $MERSIDE    If the scope is a german mount, "W" if LOOKING west, "E" if
;               LOOKING east, "_" if not a german mount.
;
;   $OBSNAME    The name of the current Observation
;
;   $OBSRA      J2000 Right Ascension of the current Observation, sexagesimal
;               without delimiters, zero-filled (e.g. "193451"). This 
;               will be valid for major planets and orbital elements, as 
;               the current coordinates will have been calculated.
;
;   $OBSDEC     J2000 Declination of the current Observation, sexagesimal
;               without delimiters, zero-filled (e.g. "+214306"). This 
;               will be valid for major planets and orbital elements, as 
;               the current coordinates will have been calculated.
;
;   $OBSPA      Equatorial Position Angle of the current Observation to the
;               nearest degree, three digits, zero-filled (e.g. "164")
;
;   $OBSSEQ     Sequence number for the current Observation's set count,
;               three digits, zero-filled (e.g. "021")
;
;   $PLNNAME    The name of the current Plan
;
;   $PRJNAME    The name of the current Project
;
;   $PRJEXID    The External ID of the current Project
;
;   $PRJCONT    The Contact Name of the current Project. If this has the ACP
;               login username in it (see $DEFPATH), that part will be
;               removed.
;
;   $USRNAME    The Scheduler User Name for the current Project.
;
;   $ACPLOGIN   The ACP web user login username, if present in the Project's
;               Contact Name (see $DEFPATH), or "_" if not present.
;
;   $DATENITE   The local date of the run, in ISO 8601 format YYYYMMDD. This
;               date changes at the time the sun crosses the local meridian.
;               Use this to put all images from one night/run into the same 
;               folder. 
;
;   $DATEUTC    The current UTC date, in ISO 8601 format YYYYMMDD
;               (e.g. "20060528")
;
;   $TIMEUTC    The current UTC time, in ISO 8601 basic format HHMMSS
;               (e.g., 142804). 
;
;   $DATELOC    The current local date, in ISO 8601 format YYYYMMDD
;               (e.g. "20060528")
;
;   $TIMELOC    The current local time, in ISO 8601 basic format HHMMSS
;               (e.g., 142804). 
;
;   $DATEJUL    The current UTC Julian date (e.g. "2453846")
