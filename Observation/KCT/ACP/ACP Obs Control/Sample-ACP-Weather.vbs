' Standard ACP Weather Safety script. Please see ACP Help, Customizing ACP, 
' Adding to ACP's Logic, Weather Safety Script. If you have a real dome Or
' if the scope can clear your roll-off roof under all conditions, then 
' you can adjust this so that the dome/roof closes right away. 
'
' NOTE: This assumes tht you have the ACP Dome Control option "Close and 
'       park/home [dome] AFTER scope is parked by script" ON/Set. 
'
' NOTE: To have your safe roof or real dome close right away, turn OFF the 
'       above option and uncomment the indicated lines for opening the dome
'
' This runs when there is a weather unsafe event.
